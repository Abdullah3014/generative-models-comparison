# Generative Models Comparison: VAE, GAN, and Diffusion

This repository provides a unified empirical framework to simulate and compare three major generative model families on synthetic 2D Gaussian Mixture data:

- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
- **Diffusion Models (DDPM-style)**

The code is lightweight, runs in Google Colab, and produces reproducible plots ready for academic manuscripts.
